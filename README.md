# semester-project-Bountouris-Panagiotis

Each folder can be implemented independently

### LQR controllers
Run the LQR.m files

### Model Predictive controllers
For the simple donut maneuver run the MPC_cl_r14.m file, while for the complex donut maneuver run the MPC_complex.m file

### Gazebo simulation
1. Modify each time the animated_obj.cc file as indicated in the beginning of the file
2. Rebuild the build folder
3. Run kartdonuts.world or kartdonuts1.world files (these 2  .world files differ only in the position of cones which help the visualization of the donuts maneuvers)
